# Logistic_Regression
The project aimed at training a model that will predict if a person have heart disease or not.
The dataset for this project was collected from kaggle.
unnamed colums were removed at the data preparation stage,converted categorical values into numerical ones.
Droped a few null values since they were insignificant, created the independent and dependnt variables.
We split the dataset to 70% training and 30% testing to enable us test our model.Finally train the model after scaling and it show that
87% of the data were predicted accurately. This was also true for the test data at approximately 87%.
we applied a few hyperparamter to check if model will improve.
At 87% accuracy, our model can predict an unseen dataset and left the result at that.
